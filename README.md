# Smart-Surveillance-System

**A smart surveillance system developed using python Opencv.** 

Everyone is familiar with the surveillance devices, which are basically used to capture a video or to monitor a provided surrounding. The main objective of this project is those devices smarter.

Most of the devices used for surveillance perform basic operation such as recording the video, and that particular video has to be monitored again by an individual to verify if   there are any irrelevant activities. Even if there are any abnormal activity that took place, there will be no immediate response from such devices.
This particular project makes those devices smart by performing the following tasks:

**•	Detecting a human in the video**

**•	Notifying the person in charge of that particular surrounding.**

These are the main functionality of this project. The project is designed in such a way that, it is capable of detecting a human being who is not allowed to enter into a place or if a person enters that place during inappropriate timings.  The system detects the person and if his activity is found to be there more than a specified time, which happens to be for seconds. Then the system will alert the person who is responsible to take further action based on the situation. The system keeps on buzzing until and unless someone reset it.
